# WordCount-MapReduce
a.	Write the WordCount program to output only those words whose frequency is larger than 6 (that is, 7 or larger). Run your program for the text in any two books from among the ones that are made available to you in the hdfs directory. Name the two books that you use as data for your program.

b.	Modify the program to output the frequencies of n-grams for n=2 in the same two textbooks that you used in (a) above. 
c.	Modify the programs to output the frequencies of those 3-grams in the same two books that have frequencies larger than 3.
